Did exploratory data analysis (EDA) & Handled class imbalance using oversampling with ADASYN. 
Used PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Tried using different ML algorithms like logistic regression, decision tree, random forest classifier to build the mode for predicting whether high value customers will churn or not.
