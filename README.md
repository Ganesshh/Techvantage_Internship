### Telecom Churn Prediction
Objective: Analyse the customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify the high  value customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

Did exploratory data analysis (EDA) & Handled class imbalance using oversampling with ADASYN. Used PCA for dimensionality reduction & Carried out hyperparametric tuning.
Tried using different ML algorithms like logistic regression, SVM, Random forest classifier to build the mode for predicting whether high value customers will churn or not. Random forest classifer model is found to have an accuracy of 95%
